# Loan-Modeling
# Business Objective
  The SBA works with lenders to provide loans to small businesses. The agency doesnâ€™t lend money directly to small business owners. Instead, it sets guidelines for loans made by     its partnering lenders, community development organizations, and micro-lending institutions. The SBA reduces risk for lenders and makes it easier for them to access capital.       That makes it easier for small businesses to get loans.
  
  Loans guaranteed by the SBA range from small to large and can be used for most business purposes, including long-term fixed assets and operating capital. Some loan programs set   restrictions on how you can use the funds, so check with an SBA-approved lender when requesting a loan. Your lender can match you with the right loan for your business needs.
